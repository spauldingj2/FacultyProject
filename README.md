# Faculty Project

**Author**: Jeanne Spaulding

**Project Repository**: https://github.com/spauldingj2/FacultyProject

## Project Overview

**Question**:
    What faculty position request type has the highest number of unbudgeted positions?

**Findings**:
    New position type requests accounted for 209 of the 296 total postition requests submitted and an overall 180 unbudgeted positions accounting for 86% of the New positions.  Replacement position type requests contributed only 20 of an overall 201 number of unbudgeted positions.

**Conclusion**:
    New faculty position request type had the highest number of positions that were not approved in the annual budget prior to initiation of the request to open the postion for hire.

**Recommendations**:
    Further analyses should be conducted to determine the statistical significance of the difference between New and Replacement unbudgeted positions.  Analyses of the breakdown of reported funding sources for positions may provide further insight into why New positions are not being approved in the annual budget prior to inititating the request to hire.
